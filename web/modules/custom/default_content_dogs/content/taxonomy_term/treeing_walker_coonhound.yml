      value: "<p>A smart, brave, and sensible hunter, the Treeing Walker Coonhound is a genuine American favorite, nicknamed \"The People's Choice.\" Don't let the name fool you'¿ Walkers are runners and are capable of covering a lot of ground in a hurry. Few things can quicken a coon hunter's pulse like the sight of this swift tricolored hound in full stride'¿the long, muscular legs, the powerful and propulsive hindquarters, and the streamlined frame all working to cover maximum ground with minimum effort. Later, basking in the warmth of a campfire after an honest night's work, this sweet-faced hound will look up and stir your soul with his gentle, pleading expression. Mercy, what a pretty picture! No wonder Treeing Walkers are called the People's Choice.</p>"
