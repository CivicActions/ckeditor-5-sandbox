      value: 'Australian Cattle Dog'
  description:
    -
      value: "<p>The compact but muscular Australian Cattle Dog, also called Blue or Red Heeler or Queensland Heeler, is related to Australia's famous wild dog, the Dingo. These resilient herders are intelligent enough to routinely outsmart their owners. Standing between 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and agility. The ACD is born with a white coat that turns either blue-gray or red. Both coat colors may feature distinctive mottling or speckling patterns. ACDs have immense work drive and excel at controlling and, of course, moving livestock. Their boundless energy and supple gait make them excellent running partners. ACDs are true-blue loyal, famously smart, tenacious, ever alert, and may be wary of strangers. If an ACD isn't challenged, it easily becomes bored and may get into mischief. It is recommended that ACD owners participate with these versatile dogs in some work, sport, or regular exercise to keep them mentally and physically fit.</p><p>Standing between 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder, the Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, hard-muscled herder of strength and agility.
